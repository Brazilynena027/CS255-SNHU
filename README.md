System Anaysis and Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?
    The driver pass project was created because there was a need for training drivers and their was a belief by the owner that students were not getting proper training which has caused so many to fail. The functions of the driverpass system was to give students access to online training materials, tests quizzes and DMV information as well as sign up for driving course with an instructior. Driverpass has three packages to choose from when selecting the driving course option. The owner would be granted access to all content and materials as well as account access to students and staff and to be able to run reports and delete or modify packages. I believe that I was able to capture the nonfunctional and functional requirements quite well. These requirements are critica to developement since these are needed to think about how the system should function. 
    
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
      I would choose my Gannt chart. I did not include color description in my chart. Going forward I will be sure into include the color descriptions as this helps to break down the hierarchies or teams. 
      
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
      I broke the users needs into individual requirements and used several different diagrams ,Use case Diagram,Activity diagram and sequence diagrams to layout the process and how each requirement should flow.
The clients Requirements are important because if there were no user requirements they system would be purposeless and the system could not be completed. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
      In designing the software the first thing to do is get the Purpose of their project,what is goal of the company, and what are they wanting to accomplish. Then I would get their requirements for the system to be developed, what they want their system to do. Then figure out the technical ad non techincal requirements,what if anything is going to be interfaced with our system and what the limitations of this system are. In the future to analyze and design a system the techniques and strategies I would use would be would be to get feedback from the team as it is important to get the handons accounts of what can improve in each section of the team. I believe that the diagrams UML case, activity, and sequence are just a few charts that can be valuable to relaying all the nessesary information to each member on the team.
